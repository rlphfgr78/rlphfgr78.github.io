  <section class="section" id="about">
    <h2>What is the Lunar Research Initiative</h2>
    <p>
      The Lunar Research Initiative (LRI) develops the scientific foundations that future lunar missions need to build safe and reliable infrastructure on the Moon.
      We combine quality engineering, reliability science, and lunar manufacturing research to create methods that mission planners can trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our work gives agencies, companies, and universities a clear path to integrate quality and risk into lunar production from the first design sketch through surface operations.

    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <div class="pillars-grid">
      <article class="pillar">
        <h3>Scientific Research</h3>
        <p>
          LRI studies the materials, processes, and environments that control lunar manufacturing performance.
          We focus on regolith based manufacturing, environmental loads, predictive quality models, and lunar specific critical to quality structures.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article class="pillar">
        <h3>Technical Standards and Frameworks</h3>
        <p>
          We create open frameworks, NASA style technical memoranda, and engineering guides that unify how teams design, qualify, and verify lunar manufacturing systems.
          Our standards help engineers translate mission requirements into reliable processes.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article class="pillar">
        <h3>Education and Outreach</h3>
        <p>
          LRI shares its work through handbooks, workshops, and public outreach.
          We support students, early career engineers, and leaders through learning materials and the Ralph Figueroa Quality Brief newsletter.

  <!-- FEATURED WORK -->
  <section class="section" id="research">
    <h2>Featured Work</h2>
    <p style="text-align:center;">
      LRI curates a growing portfolio of open publications and frameworks that support lunar mission planning.

    <div class="featured-grid">
      <article class="featured-item">
        <h3>A Risk Based Quality Architecture for Lunar Production Systems</h3>
        <p>
          A foundational framework that organizes quality and risk across mission tiers, from surface assets to integrated lunar production systems.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article class="featured-item">
        <h3>Unified Lunar Quality Framework (ULQF) Handbook</h3>
        <p>
          A practical handbook that connects critical to quality measures, predictive signatures, quality gates, and verification strategies for lunar operations.

      <article class="featured-item">
        <h3>Regolith CTQ Capability Reliability Integration</h3>
        <p>
          An analytical approach that links regolith properties, process capability, and reliability modeling for lunar manufacturing routes.

  <!-- WHY LRI -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Why LRI</h2>
    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Quality first for lunar infrastructure</h3>
    <p>
      Most lunar research focuses on technology performance alone. LRI focuses on quality and reliability from the beginning.
      We build methods that help teams ask the right questions early and connect them to verification and risk decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our work lowers mission risk, improves manufacturing confidence, and supports a safer long term human presence on the Moon.
    </p>

  <!-- GET INVOLVED -->
  <section class="section" id="contact">
    <h2>Work With the Lunar Research Initiative</h2>
    <p>
      LRI collaborates with universities, research centers, and industry partners that want to advance lunar manufacturing science and quality systems.
      Whether you plan a new study, a student project, or a mission concept, we can help frame quality, risk, and reliability for long term lunar operations.
