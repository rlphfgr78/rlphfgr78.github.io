    <h2>What is the Lunar Research Initiative</h2>
    <p>
      The Lunar Research Initiative (LRI) develops the scientific foundations that future lunar missions need to build safe and reliable infrastructure on the Moon.
      We combine quality engineering, reliability science, and lunar manufacturing research to create methods that mission planners can trust.
