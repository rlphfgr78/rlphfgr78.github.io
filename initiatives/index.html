  <h1>LRI Research Initiatives</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <p>
      The Lunar Research Initiative organizes its scientific work into four core program areas. 
      These initiatives support a structured approach to lunar manufacturing quality, predictive modeling, verification logic, and regolith-based production systems.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">

    <div class="initiative-box">
      <h2>Lunar Manufacturing Quality Architecture</h2>
      <p>
        This initiative defines the foundational quality systems required for reliable lunar operations. 
        It includes layered risk structures, mission-tier quality logic, and integrated verification models that connect system requirements with manufacturable processes. 
        The Lunar Manufacturing Quality Architecture supports end-to-end mission assurance for surface infrastructure.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="initiative-box">
      <h2>Regolith Manufacturing Systems</h2>
      <p>
        This initiative examines the performance, variability, and process capability of regolith-based manufacturing. 
        It includes studies on material preparation, mechanical properties, environmental effects, and reliability modeling. 
        The goal is to link regolith feedstock behavior with predictable manufacturing outcomes that can scale into operational production.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="initiative-box">
      <h2>Predictive Quality and Decision Support</h2>
      <p>
        This initiative develops predictive signatures, drift detection methods, and time-shifted decision structures for lunar surface systems. 
        It strengthens reliability by enabling early detection of performance changes and supports human and autonomous decision-making under lunar delay conditions. 
        This initiative anchors LRI’s predictive quality research.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="initiative-box">
      <h2>Lunar Standards and Verification</h2>
      <p>
        This initiative produces open technical frameworks, verification templates, critical-to-quality libraries, and NASA-style technical memoranda. 
        It enables consistent verification and validation across lunar manufacturing routes. 
        This work forms the backbone of LRI’s effort to standardize and elevate lunar manufacturing practices.
