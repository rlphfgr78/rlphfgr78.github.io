    <h1>LRI Research Initiatives</h1>
    <p>
      LRI focuses on a small set of initiatives that build a practical quality foundation for lunar infrastructure.
      Each initiative links theory, models, and standards to engineering decisions that mission planners must make.

        <h3>Predictive Quality Architectures</h3>
        <p>
          Designing architectures that connect critical to quality measures, predictive signatures, and verification logic across lunar missions.
          This initiative develops tools that help teams detect drift early and maintain requirement integrity under harsh conditions.

        <h3>Regolith Manufacturing Methods</h3>
        <p>
          Studying the behavior of regolith based processes, including feedstock variability, process capability, and equipment reliability.
          The work aims to translate regolith uncertainty into clear quality requirements and qualification methods.

        <h3>Operations Under Delay</h3>
        <p>
          Investigating decision loops for time delayed operations on the Moon.
          This initiative explores how monitoring, autonomy, and ground teams share responsibility when communications lag affects safety and quality.

    <h2>Opportunities for Collaboration</h2>
    <p>
      LRI welcomes collaboration with universities, research institutes, and industry teams that are exploring lunar manufacturing technologies.
      Potential collaborations include joint studies, data sharing, student projects, and aligned standards development.
