    <h1>Standards and Frameworks</h1>
    <p>
      The Lunar Research Initiative develops independent, open frameworks that help unify lunar manufacturing practices.
      These standards connect mission requirements to practical design, qualification, and verification methods for lunar surface operations.
    </p>

  <section class="section">
    <div class="framework-box">
      <h2>Unified Lunar Quality Framework (ULQF)</h2>
      <p>
        ULQF is a structured quality framework for lunar surface manufacturing.
        It links critical to quality measures, predictive signatures, environmental modifiers, and quality gates across mission phases.
        ULQF helps engineers control variation, interpret drift, and design verification plans that reflect real lunar risks.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="framework-box">
      <h2>Lunar Manufacturing Quality Architecture</h2>
      <p>
        The Lunar Manufacturing Quality Architecture defines how quality and risk align across mission tiers, from individual processes to integrated surface systems.
        It provides a consistent logic that connects requirements, risk controls, and verification activities into a single architecture.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="framework-box">
      <h2>Regolith Manufacturing Process Standards</h2>
      <p>
        These emerging standards describe expectations for regolith feedstock characterization, process capability, and equipment behavior under lunar conditions.
        The goal is to translate regolith variability into predictable, capable manufacturing routes.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="framework-box">
      <h2>Verification and Validation Frameworks</h2>
      <p>
        LRI develops verification templates and logic flows for lunar production systems.
        These frameworks map risks and critical to quality measures to test plans, environmental exposures, and acceptance criteria.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Technical Memoranda and Templates</h2>
    <p>
      LRI publishes NASA style technical memoranda that formalize specific methods, such as drift detection algorithms, load modifier models, and verification checklists.
      Future releases will include example CTQ lists, quality gate diagrams, and verification matrices that organizations can adapt for their own lunar projects.
