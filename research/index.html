    <h1>Research Library</h1>
    <p>
      The Lunar Research Initiative maintains an open research library dedicated to the science, engineering, and quality systems needed for safe and reliable lunar manufacturing.
      Our publications support mission planners, researchers, and industry teams working to develop lunar surface infrastructure.
    </p>

    <div class="section-block">
      <h2>Featured Publications</h2>
      <ul class="pub-list">
        <li>
          <div class="pub-title">A Risk Based Quality Architecture for Lunar Production Systems</div>
          <p>
            A foundational framework that organizes quality and risk across lunar mission tiers. The architecture connects mission requirements, critical to quality measures, verification gates, and operational risk pathways into a unified structure.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="pub-title">Unified Lunar Quality Framework (ULQF) Handbook</div>
          <p>
            A comprehensive guide that links critical to quality measures, predictive signatures, environmental modifiers, and quality gates for lunar surface manufacturing.
            ULQF helps engineers control variation, interpret drift, and manage verification in extreme lunar conditions.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="pub-title">Regolith CTQ Capability Reliability Integration</div>
          <p>
            A technical exploration of how regolith properties, process capability indices, and reliability models integrate into a coherent production strategy.
            This work strengthens the bridge between lunar materials science and practical manufacturing design.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="pub-title">Delay Driven Decision Loops in Lunar Surface Operations</div>
          <p>
            A study of decision making under communication delay. This publication explains how operators, autonomous systems, and lunar environmental factors interact inside time shifted loops and provides engineering controls to maintain safe behavior.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section-block">
      <h2>Technical Memoranda and Reports</h2>
      <p>
        LRI issues NASA style technical memoranda to formalize methods and provide precise, engineering grade documentation.
        Current and planned memoranda cover predictive quality structures, environmental load modifiers, verification logic for lunar additive manufacturing, and drift detection methods for lunar equipment.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-block">
      <h2>Standards and Frameworks</h2>
      <p>
        LRI develops open frameworks that support consistent lunar manufacturing practices, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Unified Lunar Quality Framework (ULQF).</li>
        <li>Lunar Manufacturing Quality Architecture.</li>
        <li>Regolith manufacturing process standards.</li>
        <li>Verification and validation frameworks for lunar production systems.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        New work will be added to this library as studies, handbooks, and technical memoranda are released.
